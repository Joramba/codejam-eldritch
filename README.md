## Project Description
The project is a small application-helper for the board game "Ancient Horror"

## Algorithm
To assemble a deck of myths, three different types of cards are used: blue, brown and green (the type is determined by the color of the strip in the card header) In addition, there are different card complexity:

* Complex cards have tentacles around the name.
* Normal cards can't have any signs. 
* Easy cards have an image of snowflakes around the name.

And 5 difficulty levels available:
* Very easy difficulty level: all cards with snowflakes are taken from the set, if there are not enough cards, ordinary cards are taken
* Easy difficulty level: cards with tentacles are removed from the set
* Medium difficulty level: set remains intact
* High difficulty level: cards with snowflakes are removed from the set
* Very high level of difficulty: all cards with tentacles are taken from the set, if there are not enough cards, ordinary cards get there
